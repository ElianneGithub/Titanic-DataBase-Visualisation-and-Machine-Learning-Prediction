# Titanic-DataBase-Visualisation-and-Machine-Learning-Prediction
We consider the dataset titanic.csv, which contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, in particular whether they survived the sinking or not. 

The purpose of this work is twofold: visualization and modeling of the data related to the survival or not of the passenger 
and the construction of a model to predict the survival or not of a passenger according to the data present in the tables .

Exercice 1 :

As a first step, we will clean up the data:
elimination of the columns for which a lot of data is missing, or not very relevant.
elimination of rows that still contain missing data after elimination of columns.


Exercice 2 :

In a second step, we will propose different types of visualisation that seem appropriate.
The purpose being to visually identify correlation patterns between the different information.

Exercice 3 :

Finally, we will propose a model to predict whether a passenger will survive or not based on the data in the table. 
We will take care to separate our data into training and test samples to evaluate our model. 
In this way we will give an estimate of the accuracy of our model (proportion of good predictions in the test sample).
